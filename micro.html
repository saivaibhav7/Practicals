      <p>Statistics on unemployment in India had traditionally been collected, compiled and disseminated once every ten years by the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MLE), primarily from sample studies conducted by the National Sample Survey Office.[1][2] Other than these 5-year sample studies, India has – except since 2017 – never routinely collected monthly, quarterly or yearly nationwide employment and unemployment statistics. In 2016, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy – a non-government entity based in Mumbai, started sampling and publishing monthly unemployment in India statistics.</p>

        <p>1.Murder: Murder is a serious crime in India and is punishable by law. The most common motive for murder is personal enmity, followed by robbery, dowry disputes, and domestic violence. Crimes such as honor killings and mob lynchings are also prevalent in certain parts of the country.</p>

        <p>2.Rape: Rape is a heinous crime and is taken very seriously in India. The country has seen a rise in the number of rape cases in recent years, and there have been protests and movements demanding stricter laws and punishment for perpetrators of sexual violence. In addition to rape, crimes such as sexual harassment, molestation, and eve-teasing are also prevalent in India.</p>

      <p>3.Theft and Robbery: Theft and robbery are common crimes in India, with pickpocketing, purse-snatching, and burglary being the most common types of theft. Robbery can occur in various forms, such as armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking.</p>

      <p>4.Cyber Crimes: With the increasing use of the internet and technology, cyber crimes such as hacking, phishing, identity theft, and cyberbullying are becoming more prevalent in India. The government has introduced laws to tackle cybercrime, but there is still a long way to go in terms of creating awareness and preventing such crimes.</p>

      <p>5.Corruption: Corruption is a major problem in India and affects various aspects of society, including politics, law enforcement, and business. Bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism are some of the most common forms of corruption in India.</p>

      <p>6.Terrorism: Terrorism is a major threat to India's security, and the country has faced several terrorist attacks over the years. The most significant of these include the Mumbai attacks in 2008, the Parliament attack in 2001, and the Pulwama attack in 2019.</p>

      <p>The Indian government has introduced various laws and measures to tackle these crimes, but there is still a long way to go in terms of preventing and reducing crime in the country. It is important for individuals to be aware of their surroundings and take necessary precautions to avoid becoming victims of crime.</p>
