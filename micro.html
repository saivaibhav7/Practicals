      <h3>Statistics on unemployment in India had traditionally been collected, compiled and disseminated once every ten years by the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MLE), primarily from sample studies conducted by the National Sample Survey Office.Other than these 5-year sample studies, India has – except since 2017 – never routinely collected monthly, quarterly or yearly nationwide employment and unemployment statistics. In 2016, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy – a non-government entity based in Mumbai, started sampling and publishing monthly unemployment in India statistics.</h3>

      <b>
       <center><h2>National Sample Survey</h2></center>
      </b>

        <p>The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has been the key governmental agency in India at the national and state levels to study employment, unemployment and unemployment rates through sample surveys. It does not report employment or unemployment results every quarter nor every year, but generally only once every 5 years.[1][2] The last three officially released NSSO survey and report on employment and unemployment were completed in 2004–2005, in 2009–2010, and 2011–2012. The 2011-2012 survey was initiated by the Congress-led Manmohan Singh's government because it was felt that the higher unemployment numbers in the 2009-2010 report may have been affected by poor monsoons, and an early survey might yield more accurate and better data.[2] There was no NSSO survey between 2012 and 2017, and a new survey was initiated in 2017–2018. This report has not been officially released by the BJP-led Narendra Modi's government, but the report has been leaked to the media</p>

            <center><b><h2>Labour bureau reports</h2></b></center>


        <p>According to ILO, the NSSO surveys are India's most comprehensive as they cover small villages in remote corners and islands of India.[1] However, this survey uses unconventional and India-specific terminology. It estimates the activity status of a person by different approaches i.e. "usual status" unemployment and "current status" unemployment. These estimates yield various forms of unemployment numbers, according to an ILO report, and the totals vary based on, factors such as whether a person has, for pay or no pay, "worked at least for 30 days during the reference period of 365", "worked for at least 1 hour on any day during the 7 days preceding the date of survey", and an estimate for "person-hours worked in the reference week" according to its statistical methods".[1] From its sample survey, it estimates a wide range of employment and unemployment statistics, along with the total population of the nation, gender distribution, and a host of other data. The NSSO methodology has been controversial, praised for its scope and effort,[1] also criticized for its "absurd" results and inconsistencies.</p>
          <center><b><h2>CMIE reports</h2></b></center>


  <p>According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Private Limited (CMIE),[9] India has never tracked and published monthly, quarterly or yearly employment and unemployment data for its people. This may have been a political convenience, states Mahesh Vyas, as "no measurements means there are no [political] arguments" about unemployment in India. CMIE, a non-government private entity, started to survey and publish monthly unemployment data for the first time in Indian history in 2016. Its data collection methodology and reports differ from those published by the NSSO.</p>

       <center> <h1>Types of Unemployment in India
        </h1></center>
        <p>
            <h4>In India, there are seven types of unemployment. The types of unemployment are discussed below:</h4>
            
            <p><b>Disguised Unemployment:</b> This is a type of unemployment where people employed are more than actually needed. Disguised unemployment is generally traced in unorganised sectors or the agricultural sectors.</p>
            
            <p><b>Structural Unemployment:</b> This unemployment arises when there is a mismatch between the worker’s skills and availability of jobs in the market. Many people in India do not get job matching to their skills or due to lack of required skills they do not get jobs and because of poor education level, it becomes important to provide them related training. </p>
            
            <p><b>Seasonal Unemployment:</b> That situation of unemployment when people do not have work during certain seasons of the year such as labourers in India rarely have occupation throughout the year.</p>
            
            <p><b>Vulnerable Unemployment:</b> People are deemed unemployed under this unemployment. People are employed but informally i.e. without proper job contracts and thus records of their work are never maintained. It is one of the main types of unemployment in India.</p>
            
            <p><b>Technological Unemployment:</b> The situation when people lose their jobs due to advancement in technologies. In 2016, the data of the World Bank predicted that the proportion of jobs threatened by automation in India is 69% year-on-year.</p>
            
            <p><b>Cyclical Unemployment:</b> unemployment caused due to the business cycle, where the number of unemployed heads rises during recessions and declines with the growth of the economy. Cyclical unemployment figures in India are negligible. </p>
            
            <p><b>Frictional Unemployment:</b> this is a situation when people are unemployed for a short span of time while searching for a new job or switching between jobs. Frictional Unemployment also called Search Unemployment, is the time lag between the jobs. Frictional unemployment is considered as voluntary unemployment because the reason for unemployment is not a shortage of jobs, but in fact, the workers themselves quit their jobs in search of better opportunities.</p>
        </p>
        <center><h1>Causes of Unemployment</h1></center>
        
            <h3>The major causes of unemployment in India are as mentioned below:</h3>
            <ul>
            <b><li>Large population</li></b>
            <b><li>Lack of vocational skills or low educational levels of the working population.</li></b>
            <b><li>Labour-intensive sectors suffering from the slowdown in private investment particularly after demonetisation</li></b>
            <b><li>The low productivity in the agriculture sector plus the lack of alternative opportunities for agricultural workers that makes transition among the three sectors difficult.</li></b>
            <b><li>Legal complexities, Inadequate state support, low infrastructural, financial and market linkages to small businesses making such enterprises unviable with cost and compliance overruns.</li></b>
            <b><li>Inadequate growth of infrastructure and low investments in the manufacturing sector, hence restricting the employment potential of the secondary sector.</li></b>
            <b><li>The huge workforce of the country is associated with the informal sector because of a lack of required education or skills, and this data is not captured in employment statistics.</li></b>
            <b><li>The main cause of structural unemployment is the education provided in schools and colleges are not as per the current requirements of the industries.</li></b>
            <b><li>Regressive social norms that deter women from taking/continuing employment.</li></b>
            </ul>
            <center><h1>Impact Of Unemployment</h1></center>
            <h3>The unemployment in any nation have the following effects on the economy:</h3>
            <ul>
              <b><li>The problem of unemployment gives rise to the problem of poverty.</li></b>
                <b><li>The government suffers extra borrowing burden because unemployment causes a decrease in the production and less consumption of goods and services by the people.
                </li></b>
                <b><li>Unemployed persons can easily be enticed by antisocial elements. This makes them lose faith in the democratic values of the country.
                </li></b>
                <b><li>People unemployed for a long time may indulge in illegal and wrong activities for earning money which increases crime in the country.
                </li></b>
                <b><li>Unemployment affects the economy of the country as the workforce that could have been gainfully employed to generate resources actually gets dependent on the remaining working population, thus escalating socio-economic costs for the state. For instance, a 1 % increase in unemployment reduces the GDP by 2 %.
                </li></b>
                <b><li>It is often seen that unemployed people end up getting addicted to drugs and alcohol or attempts suicide, leading to losses to the human resources of the country.
                </li></b>

        
        <h1>Crime Rate in India</h1>
        <p>The crime rate in India has fluctuated over the years, with some years showing an increase in crime rates and others showing a decrease. According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the overall crime rate (crimes per 100,000 people) in India was 415.6 in 1990 and 344.7 in 2020, which is a decrease of about 17% over 30 years. However, it is important to note that this overall figure includes a wide range of crimes, and the rates for individual types of crime may have varied significantly.</p>
